- 👋 Hi, I’m @CaperJohn
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about SQL, ADO.NET, ASP.NET, MVC controllers and then seeing where the road leads to from there. 
- 🌱 I have learned a bit about these topics in a Certificate program I previously studied. Now I would like to get refreshed and develop more skills. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects in using SQL data bases, web page design with ADO.NET and ASP.NET.  
- 📫 I can be reached at jk950342@hotmail.com if anyone is interested in helping me.
